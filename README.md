# COVID19-Tracker - India
A Covid-19 state wise statistic app to track the pandemic effect on India.

## Case Study

I have build this app in the hope that this will be the one of the first app to provide the stats information on your finger tips. I have build this app within 16 hours of code. I have used technology like MVVM, DayNight theme, Kotlin, coroutines etc.

### Results

When creating this app I never thought I would have to face such kind of issue. But lesson learnt, now I know that what to do and what not to. This is a sensitive topic and google rejected my app as I was not a govt entitiy or I don't have said permission from my government.
